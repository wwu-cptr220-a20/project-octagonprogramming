            <h2>Topic Description</h2>
            <p>The biggest stumbling block to new content creators now is getting people to view your content. On streaming platforms such as twitch, there are several big names that soak up all the viewers making it difficult for people just now getting into it to get viewers. Another issue with websites like twitch, there are so many poeple trying to make a name for themselves that viewers who are looking to watch the smaller streamers have a hard time finding good ones. Finally, platforms such as twitch and youtube have become increasingly invloved in politics and other scandals.</p>
            <p>What I propose is the creation of a streaming and/or video upload service to compete with the bigger platforms such as twitch and youtube. Currently the only major competitors in the streaming are twitch, youtube, and facebook gaming. I feel if there were more diverse platforms than what are currently available, discoverablility of tallented content creators would go up. I personally know several people who make high quality content in their off time but due to the low exposure of the current platform, find it hard to get the "audience." Another platform that is notoriously bad for new content creators looking to make a name for themselves is youtube. While youtube's main focus is not on streaming it does have that capability. Youtube's main focus is video uploads. While there are other platforms, youtube is the leader of the pack in this area. On top of that, youtube has had some issues with their algorithms incorrectly censoring content and demonitising videos. I feel that a different platfrom that focused on community monitored content would be a better competitor to youtube.</p>
            <p>For my project I would like to research how to build a content creation platform and then build one that could be used.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Small Scale Streaming Service</li>
                <p>To keep this project in a reasonable scope for this class we could start with a small scale service that we test with a small number of people. This way if we are successful we can carry this over to future projects outside of this class.</p>
                <li>Upload platform</li>
                <p>The university currently(from what I have seen) uses youtube to upload videos as well as stream events. If the university had its own platform it could upload to it wouldn't have to use a platform such as youtube.</p>
